# Garage-Classifier

## Problem statement ##
Build AI algorithm with GUI to categorize waste items from an image captured using a mobile phone. Categorization involves separating waste into:

* Liquid Waste
* Hazardous Waste
* Medical/Clinical Waste
* E-Waste
* Recyclable Waste
* Green Waste

which is further sub-categorized into paper, cans, plastics, syringer, batteries etc. This program was creted based on report of managing waste in emerging economies for context on the importance of waste management and the threat waste poses to waste segregator people.

## Solution ##

The AI algorithm classifies the waste into 6 major categories and 50+ sub categories, so that waste segregation is accurate. This program is ready to be incorporated with a robotic arm via Nvidia Jetforce or Ardruno UNO and it will classify thousands of waste materials in fraction of minutes without risk of getting harmed.
